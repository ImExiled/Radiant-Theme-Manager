The below is what the json for a theme list looks like when not minified. This is also refered to as beautified.

{
   "lists":[
      "https://rawgit.com/bentenz5/Radiant-Theme-Manager/master/themes.json",
      "https://example.com/theme2.json",
      "etc"
   ],
   "names":[
      "NCE",
      "NameInRTMList2",
      "etc"
   ]
}

You MUST minify the JSON to have it load in RTM. Below is what minifed json looks like.

{"lists":["https://rawgit.com/bentenz5/Radiant-Theme-Manager/master/themes.json","https://example.com/theme2.json","etc"],"names":["NCE","NameInRTMList2","etc"]}

Hope this helps until I figure out a better saving solution.
